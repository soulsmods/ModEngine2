# List of files that will be loaded into the game as DLL mods.
# Absolute paths to mods are supported but must use '\\' to separate path items. For example, if your mod is at E:\coolstuff\coolmod.dll, you must enter
# the path in the config as "E:\\coolstuff\\coolmod.dll".
# If there's no drive specifier (C:, D:, etc), the path is relative to where the launcher is located. For example, having the path as "mod.dll" will tell
# Mod Engine 2 to look for the directory mod inside the Mod Engine 2 directory with the launcher.
#
# Multiple mods must be separated with commas. For example if you have 3 mods, you will have something like the following:
# external_dlls = [ "coolmod.dll", "D:\\nicemods\\nicemod.dll", "sosofolder\sosomod.dll" ]
external_dlls = []

# is probably not for you.
